# A Notes App

## History
Based on a [broken tutorial](https://coligo.io/learn-vuex-by-building-notes-app/) that I was using to learn Vuex.
Now powered by a Firebase API.

Uses the [webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) [vuexfire](https://github.com/posva/vuexfire), [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/), and [vue-router](router.vuejs.org/en/).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
